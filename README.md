# 🚀 Job Scheduler

A powerful and flexible Job Scheduling System that allows users to schedule backend tasks, execute binaries, and trigger asynchronous Kafka messages.  
Includes a Spring Boot backend and a React frontend for complete workflow management.

---

## 🧩 Overview

The Job Scheduler provides a centralized platform to:

- Run jobs at specific times  
- Execute binaries (JAR/NPM) stored in MinIO  
- Trigger delayed messages  
- Schedule recurring jobs (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly)  
- Track execution status and metadata  
- Manage everything via a clean UI  

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔹 Job Scheduling Capabilities

#### **1. Specific Time Scheduling**
a. Schedule jobs at an exact timestamp  
b. Full support for multiple time zones  
c. Runs the associated binary and tracks execution state:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Success  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Failure  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. In-Progress  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. Skipped  

---

#### **2. Immediate Execution**
a. Execute any job instantly  
b. Result and logs are stored for auditing  

---

#### **3. Delayed Messaging**
a. Send a message after a specified delay (e.g., after 10 minutes)  
b. Messages are dispatched asynchronously via Kafka  
c. Supports client-provided metadata  

---

### 🔹 Frequency-Based Scheduling

Recurring jobs supported:

- ⏳ Hourly  
- 📅 Daily  
- 📆 Weekly (select days)  
- 🗓️ Monthly (select dates)  

---

## 📘 Example Use Cases

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **One-Time Job** | Run a job at **11 AM IST** once |
| **Weekly Job** | Execute at **12 PM GMT** on **Tuesdays & Fridays** |
| **Delayed Reminder** | Send a Kafka message **10 minutes** later |

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### **Backend**
- Java + Spring Boot — business logic & scheduler  
- Kafka — asynchronous messaging  
- MinIO — binary (JAR/NPM) storage  
- PostgreSQL — message & job metadata storage  

### **Frontend**
- React.js — responsive client UI  

---

## 📝 Assumptions

- Kafka handles all async message deliveries  
- MinIO stores job execution binaries  
- PostgreSQL persists job logs, schedules, and metadata  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- ⚡ Migrate to YugabyteDB for horizontally scalable storage  
- ⚛️ Introduce Next.js for server-side rendering & performance  
- 🎨 Expand and refine the UI for an improved developer experience
